# MozAnalytics
I’ve been helping new iOS developers learn to develop mobile software. This is an example iOS App that utilizes the Mozscape API.

I’d like to share some of what I’ve learned about encoding signatures in iOS using Swift. This project uses HMAC SHA1 to encode an authentication message to use the Mozscape API.

Thank you taking a look!
